# Demo Video Checklist

Duration: 5 to 7 minutes

Required footage:
- Initial UI generation from a clean start
- Iterative modification (not full regeneration)
- Live preview update after each change
- Explanation output from the explainer agent
- Version rollback (no LLM call)
- Malicious prompt rejection (e.g., inline styles, unknown component)

Narration notes:
- Mention the deterministic component system
- Mention AST-based validation and safe rendering
- Mention planner -> generator -> explainer separation

Capture tips:
- Show the version list before and after rollback
- Show validation status in the UI
- Keep prompts short and focused
