This layout is likely chosen because it provides a clean and organized structure for displaying multiple components, making it ideal for a dashboard that needs to display various information and charts.\\n\\n**Why Components were Selected:**\\nThe following components are selected for this layout:\\n\\n1. **Navbar**: A navigation bar is a common component in many applications, providing a way for users to navigate between different sections of the application. In this case, the navbar is used to display the title \\\"Dashboard\\\".\\n2. **Card**: A card component is often used to display information in a concise and visually appealing way. In this case, the card is used to display the title \\\"Revenue\\\".\\n3. **Chart**: A chart component is used to display data in a graphical format. In this case, the chart is used to display a revenue chart, but it currently has no data.\\n\\n**What was Modified (if applicable):**\\nThere are no changes listed in the \\\"changes\\\" section, which means that no modifications were made to the original plan. The generated code is a direct result of the plan, with no additional changes or modifications.\",\r\n    \"validation\":  {\r\n                       \"componentCheck\":  true,\r\n                       \"propCheck\":  true\r\n                   }\r\n}"
